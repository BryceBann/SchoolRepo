    <p>The Nashville Predators have been a NHL team brought to the skinny state of Tennessee in 1998 just a few short years after i was birthed into this world. Through the years 
       the Preds have started to turn around from their god awful first year, looking at you Gloden Knights and Seattle Kraken. We have enforcers who had a train horn when they would
       give a other player the starting of CTE, high scoring players who would go and score so many goals to set records that our little team have never seen.
