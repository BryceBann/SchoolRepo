About Me

This is just a simple webpage I will be using to practice coding and web development, i will be practing basic fundimentals and more advanced thinds as the time comes.

I will try and set up the main page as a link portale to use to see progress with week by week assignments and outside practice as well as a short about me section for the lead up to this point in my life.

Thank you
