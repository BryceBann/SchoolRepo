            <p>I was born in the growing city of Nashville Tennessee in the late 90's to two loving parents living on the outskirt of Nashville wanting to start a family. 
                A few years later they brought my little sister into this world, me and my sister spent many of summers at the ymca as my mother was a pre-school at the local ymca when we were 
            younger</p>
