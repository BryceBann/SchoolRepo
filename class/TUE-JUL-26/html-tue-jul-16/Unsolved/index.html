     <p>Born and raised in the growing city of Nashville Tennessee little me was not ready for the glories and
      stnage things that the city had in store for me. Growing up and remembering going downtown for Titans games and seeing 
      no highrises small streets, only a few places to go for a night out on one street. To seeing the city grow with huge 
      amounts of growth not only in population but as well as high rises and more.
